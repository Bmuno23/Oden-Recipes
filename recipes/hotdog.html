        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Another widely eaten dish with multiple combinations. Originally coming from Germany(shocker) this unique recipe of sausage and bun can be professionally cooked or simply thrown into a microwave.</p>
        <p>Its a staple food in todays American culture being served at only the most American of celebrations including the 4th of july. What can I say we Americans love our weiners ;).</p>
        <p>I'm not sure why I have this on here as a recipe. Honestly if you can't figure this one out on your own(probs emily) then you shouldn't be cooking in the first place.</p>
