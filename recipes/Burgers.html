        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Start by Mixing your 80/20 mix in a small tray. Remember not to apply too much pressure or you'll end up with tough patties</li></p>
            <p><li>Season your meat with salt and pepper</li></p>
            <p><li>Now split your meat into equal patties. Grab about 5 to 6 ounces of meat and roll it into a ball.</li></p>
            <p><li>Place your ball onto a metal tray and lightly press it down. Your patties should be about 3/4 to an inch thick and about the width of whatever bun you are using.</li></p>
            <p><li>Now onto grilling the burgers. Preheat your grill, add a bit of canola oil to the grill. Once the oil starts to smoke your grill is ready to cook</li></p>
            <p><li>Once the grill is ready, season the outside of the patty on last time then add them to the grill. For juicier burgers <strong>Do not press down.</strong></li></p>
            <p><li>Let 5 minutes go by, then flip the burgers. </li></p>
